                                Matías joined my team as a Senior Machine Learning Engineer in a contract position. His
                                impact was immediate
                                and Matías brought great value to our team, both from a technical standpoint with his
                                expert knowledge in
                                computer vision and deep convolutional neural networks, but also from a leadership and
                                managerial standpoint.
                                Similarly impressive was Matías' ability to adapt and learn new technologies with ease,
                                quickly becoming an SME
                                on our team in areas he'd recently picked up. Lastly, Matías' emotional intelligence and
                                soft skills are
                                exemplary and brought real benefits to our team. He makes those around him more
                                productive, and for this
                                reason alone I wouldn't hesitate to hire him again. Very best of luck going forwards
                                Matías.

                                Matias has worked with us on a particularly challenging machine learning project that
                                required multiple
                                simultaneous skills, both technical and soft. He quickly implemented a 3D CNN that
                                reached state of the art
                                performance, following best practices for validation, implementing different data
                                augmentation techniques,
                                etc. But before that he designed a flexible database to accommodate data from disparate
                                sources into a
                                homogeneous structure for training/testing, he designed code flexible enough to move
                                training from different
                                clusters and HCP systems, and enabled non-standard applications of the resulting models.
                                He accomplished all
                                of this in mere 6 months, following quite ill-posed specifications on our part, which
                                speaks to his
                                adaptability. He is a great communicator and our daily interactions were always fluid
                                and smooth. We already
                                miss him in our team. I can't recommend him enough!

                                I worked with Matias on quite a few CV/ML research projects while I was a research staff
                                member in IBM Research. I am confident to say that Matias is the best person that I had
                                been working with in IBM. He is very proactive in making progress on the projects and
                                humble to learn new things. He is independent and always able to get things done beyond
                                expectations. Matias also has a solid background in machine learning such that he can
                                come up with deep learning models for different tasks. He is also strong in engineering
                                with rich experience in implementing and evaluating deep learning models. I would
                                recommend him to any company. If you are a hiring manager, be prepared to be "pushed" by
                                him. He will be finishing tasks fast and always asking for more :-)

                                amount of creativity to solve complex challenges. I've particularly enjoyed his
                                insatiable level of curiosity, and his responsiveness – he will always rise up to a

                                I hired Matias for the Machine Learning position at Wevat and worked alongside him
                                during his time at Wevat. Although my knowledge in this area is limited, Matias was
                                always very humble and explained things in a way for the team to understand. I found
                                that he is an extremely passionate person regarding his work in Data Science and Machine
                                Learning, and also very talented.

                                He also has a great "learn it all" attitude which I find really impressive. His thirst
                                for learning new things is admirable, I have definitely taken some inspiration from him
                                in this regard!

                                Matias also worked well in regards to remote working and timezone issues. He has no
                                trouble with being vocal about any issues and blockers, and always gave good visibility
                                of his work.

                                I would recommend for future companies for sure! <i

                                I had the pleasure of working with Matias on some machine learning projects at Wevat and
                                found him to be an exceptionally dedicated and talented individual. We were based in
                                different time zones yet his great communication and reliability made it feel like we
                                were working side-by-side. Matias was able to deliver effective data solutions in very
                                tight timeframes, often suggesting clever workarounds to maximise impact whilst
                                minimising cost. I was particularly impressed by his curiosity and empathy – he went out
                                of his way to understand the broader commercial context of the projects and to work with
                                non-technical team members, making him a real asset to our cross-functional team. <i

                                Matias was the first machine learning engineer to join our product team of 8 people
                                (distributed across multiple countries). After joining, he quickly figured out how each
                                part of the company works and suggested areas he could work on that would bring the most
                                value.

                                As most of the team was not very familiar with machine learning, Matias organised a
                                lunch and learn in which he explained what kind of problems it can be used solve. He
                                then helped to set the direction of his work, proposing several projects which we then
                                prioritised. Whenever Matias worked on a project, he would provide clear and regular
                                progress updates, clarifying any questions and ambiguity. This made it really easy to
                                work with Matias as he proved to be a manager of one.

                                Matias was accommodating to the time difference with others in the team and easy to
                                communicate with, both in real time and async. While working with him, I also noticed
                                that he’s great at taking on feedback and trying out new ideas. I really enjoyed working
                                with Matias and was impressed by his attitude to work, communication and ability to get
                                things done. </p>

                                needed for the project was only matched by his dedication to work. I highly recommend
